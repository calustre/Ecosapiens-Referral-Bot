# Ecosapiens-Referral-Bot

Ecosapiens-Referral-Bot is a Node.js script designed by `dante4rt` to automate the creation of referrals for the Ecosapiens platform. It intelligently manages referral creation, allowing users to specify the number of referrals and ensuring they are processed efficiently over time to avoid spam detection.

## Features

- **Custom Referral Counts:** Users can specify the exact number of referrals they wish to create.
- **Rate Limiting:** To prevent spam detection, the bot creates up to 5 referrals per hour.
- **Automated Wallet Creation:** Each referral is linked to a newly created Ethereum wallet address.
- **Email Generation:** Automatic generation of unique email addresses for each referral.
